Since the current codebase is primarily for testing purposes it isn't made to fit every setup.

To get this up and running without config tweaking do as follows:

1: Install packages: apache2, apache2-mod-php5, php5, php5-sqlite, php5-mysql, php5-curl, (sqlite3)

2: Extract files in a folder of your choosing

3: Create a vhost with the following content:
	<VirtualHost <hostname/ip/*>:port>
	    ServerName <server name here>
	    ServerAlias <alias here>
	    DocumentRoot /path/to/the/folder/www-root

	    <Directory /path/to/the/folder/www-root>
	        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
	        AllowOverride All
	        allow from all
	    </Directory>
	</VirtualHost>

4: 'a2enmod php5' and 'a2enmod rewrite'

5: Restart apache

6: symlink/link/copy you Thumbnails folder to www-root/thumbs folder (contents of Thumbnails folder should be directly under www-root/thumbs/)

7: Make sure that the apache/web-server user (ubuntu: www-data) has read and write permissions to files/folders recursively in:
	* XBMC-Database-Manager/data/
	* XBMC-Database-Manager/www-root/thumbs

8: Point you web browser to the application URL and you should get the install/setup screen
